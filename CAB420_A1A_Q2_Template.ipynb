    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief template for CAB420 Assignment 1A, Question 2. It simply implements the data loading, and splitting the data into the predictors and response. You are to use the data splits defined here in your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template also provides other suggestions around how to approach the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure you read the assignment brief on canvas, and check the FAQ for other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: File paths used in this template may need to change for your local machine. Please set these based on your local file system structure.**"
